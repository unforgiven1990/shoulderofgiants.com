How To Demonstrate It?</h2><ul><li>The 20-80 rule effect was found by the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto in 1896.</li><li>He observed that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by around 20% of the people.</li><li>He also witnessed the same ratio with plants in his garden.</li><li>Around 20% of the fruits beared 80% fruit.</li></ul></section><section class="scrollspy mt-5" spy-title="3.

Why Does It Exist?"><h2>4. Why Does It Exist?</h2><ul><li><strong>Related to Normal Distribution:</strong> One of the most common distributions in nature is the normal distribution. A normal distribution explains the average relationship between <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221118115544/https:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables" target="_blank">two independent</a> variables, input (x-axis) and output (y-axis). Normal distributions are important in statistics and often used in the natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are unknown. In a normal distribution, roughly 20% of the x values create approximately 80% of the y values, as seen in the chart. This is why the ratio for the Pareto effect is about 20:80. This is to be understood as a rule of thumb, the numbers could sometimes also be 70-30 or 60-40. As long as the two are independent, the 20/80 rule will apply. For example, the circle scope depends on the circle radios shown by the formula <strong>U = 2 · r · π. </strong>The 20/80 rule does not apply in this case.</li></ul></section><section class="scrollspy mt-5" spy-title="5. How Do I Benefit From It?"><h2>5. How Do I Benefit From It?</h2><ul><li><strong>Do:</strong> Once understood the Pareto effect, a decision maker should leverage the most from the 20% input. For example, Jeff Bezos only puts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221118115544/https:/www.cnbc.com/2018/11/20/why-jeff-bezos-schedules-challenging-meetings-at-10-am.html" target="_blank">critical meetings in the morning</a> when his brain is the clearest and his productivity is the highest. Work smart instead of work hard, leverage the most effective 20% to produce the 80% result.</li><li><strong>Don’t:</strong> Understand that in a lot of situations, the input and output relation is non-linear. Some input causes more output and vice versa. Do not always expect linear relation as some causations are rather exponential rather than linear.</li></ul></section>
